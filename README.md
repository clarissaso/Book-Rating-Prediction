*Overview*

The goal of this Project is to build and critically analyse supervised Machine Learning methods to predict the ratings of books based on their titles, authors, descriptions and other features. There are three levels of rating, 3, 4 and 5, for each book.

This assignment aims to reinforce the largely theoretical lecture concepts surrounding data representation, clas- sifier construction, evaluation and error analysis, by applying them to an open-ended problem. You will also have an opportunity to practice your general problem-solving skills, written communication skills, and critical thinking skills.
